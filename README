Ecru 0.1.0

What is this?
=============

  Ecru is a C runtime for the E language (http://erights.org/).

  Ecru is at a very early stage of development, so only implements a small
  portion of the features found in E-on-Java. However, it supports enough of
  the language to run the bytecode compiler. So far, Ecru supports:

  - All of Kernel-E's semantics (except for meta.getScope(), meta.syntax(), and
    auditors).

  - All of the objects for which there are special syntax (strings,
    quasiliterals, integers, float64s, booleans, characters, ConstLists,
    ConstMaps, OrderedRegions, Promises/Resolvers, Slots, VarSlots), though
    many methods are currently unimplemented.

  - Guards for these types.

  - Simple emaker import, loading bytecode files with fully-qualified names
    from a directory defined at compile time.

  - ConstSets, FlexSets, FlexMaps, and FlexLists.

  - All the objects required by 0.9 syntax expansion (except TypeDesc and
    MessageDesc).

  - Vats support message queuing and turn execution.

  Notable unimplemented features at this point include:

  - Message buffering on Promises.

  - Most of the methods on 'E' or 'Ref'.

  - Any quasiparser other than simple__quasiParser.


How do I install it?
====================
  First, install the packages named in DEPENDENCIES.  Ecru uses Autotools, so
  the standard './configure', 'make', 'make install' procedure should be all
  you need. 'make check' will run the C unit tests.  'trial monte.test' (if you
  have Twisted's "trial" unit test tool installed) will run the Python unit
  tests. See the included standard Autotools INSTALL document for further
  installation details.


How can I try it out?
=====================

  Ecru currently includes a frontend written in Python that provides a simple
  REPL, located in scripts/ecru. 

  The E script in scripts/compile.e accepts E source on stdin and outputs
  bytecode on stdout. The 'ecru_driver' executable compiled by the default make
  rule accepts bytecode on stdin and runs it.


Where can I find more information?
==================================

Ecru's project page is http://launchpad.net/ecru - bug and patches can be filed
there, as well as questions submitted. Ecru developers can be found on IRC at
#erights on irc.freenode.net.
