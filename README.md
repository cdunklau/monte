Monte
=====

Monte is a dynamic programming language inspired by Python and E.

This repository houses information about the Monte language, but no actual
implementation code. For a Monte implementation, see
[Typhon](https://github.com/monte-language/typhon).

[Monte's documentation](http://monte.readthedocs.org/en/latest/index.html) is
on ReadTheDocs. Please remember that Monte is a very new language being worked
on by a couple busy people in their free time, so the docs probably won't
answer all of your questions yet. 

Please [submit an issue](https://github.com/monte-language/monte/issues/new)
if you have a problem with the docs, telling us what question you had and
where you expected to find the answer. Or come say hi on IRC, in #monte on
irc.freenode.net!
