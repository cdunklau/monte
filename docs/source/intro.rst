Introduction
============

What's Monte?
-------------

Monte is a high-level programming language whose design philosophy is
that **secure distributed computing should not be hard**. It provides
much of the expressive convenience of python but also robust
composition using object capabilities in the tradition of E [#]_.

.. note:: While Monte usable and most architectural issues are
	  resolved, it is still undergoing rapid development.
	  See :ref:`roadmap` for details.

.. sidebar:: The origin of Monte's name

   The Monte language has its roots in the E and Python languages. We
   took "Monty" from "Monty Python", and put an "e" in there. Thus,
   "Monte".


Why Monte?
----------

Because `everything is broken`__. Python has great usability, borne
out by a large developer community, but it shares a fundamentally
brittle architecture with much of today's programming languages and
platforms: *insecurity anywhere is a threat to security everywhere*.
While E is comparatively obscure, its object capability discipline
naturally supports the *principle of least authority* so that
malicious or faulty code in one part of a system is straightforwardly
contained. Monte provides the robust composition features of E
in a form that's convenient to the Python developer community.

A Taste of Monte
----------------

Let's see what a simple web server looks like in monte:

.. literalinclude:: tut/web1.mt
    :linenos:
    :language: monte

The ``imports`` line begins a :ref:`module <modules>` and we declare
that this module ``exports`` its ``main`` function, as is conventional
for executable programs.

The :ref:`def expression<def>` for defining the ``helloWeb`` function is
similar to python and the like.

.. todo:: Forward ref :ref:`auditors` or find a way to elide
          ``DeepFrozen``. (Issue #43).

The ``smallBody`` import works much like python's ``from
lib.http.resource import smallBody``, using :ref:`pattern matching
<patterns>` to bind names to objects imported from :ref:`modules
<modules>`.

.. todo:: hoist imports to toplevel once these library modules
          have gone through the module migration.

The ``escape`` expression introduces an :ref:`ejector <ejector>` called
``badRequest``, which we use to deal with ill-formed requests in a
fail-stop manner in case the ``request`` doesn't match the
``[[verb, path], headers]`` pattern.

The ``body`` is defined using :ref:`method calls<message_passing>`
on the imported ``tag`` object.

The critical distinction between monte and other memory-safe dynamic
languages is that monte is an :ref:`object capability <ocap>`
lanugage. Powerful objects such as ``currentProcess`` and
``makeTCP4ServerEndpoint`` are not in any global namespace; they
cannot be imported. Rather, they are provided explicitly to the
``main`` function. Except by explicit delegation, no code can do
anything more more than create objects (including functions) in
memory. It cannot read from nor write to files [#]_, access the
network, clobber global state, or launch missiles.

By straightforward inspection, we can see that
  - only one TCP port is ever created;
  - its port number is taken from the last command-line argument.


Getting Started
---------------

.. note:: Installing monte is in transition. The original python
	  implementation in the monte repository is largely obsolete
	  in favor of typhon.  See :ref:`roadmap` and the `monte
	  wiki`__ for more.

Interacting with the Monte REPL
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Monte has a traditional "Read - Evaluate - Print Loop", or REPL, for
exploration. For example::

  >>> 1 + 1
  2

  >>> "abc".size()
  3


Editor Syntax Highlighting
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Atom
++++

Use Atom to install the package `language-monte`__.

Diagnostics, Documentation, and Debugging
-----------------------------------------

Monte strives to provide useful error messages and self-documenting objects::

  â–²> help(Ref)
  Result: Object type: RefOps
  Ref management and utilities.
  Method: broken/1
  Method: isBroken/1
  Method: isDeepFrozen/1
  ...

Currently the most convenient way to print out messages from your program is
with the ``trace()`` and ``traceln()`` built-in functions. The only difference
between them is that ``traceln()`` automatically adds a newline.
