Why Monte?
----------

Don't we have enough languages already? How could we justify bringing
yet another programming language into the world?

Because **secure distributed computing should not be hard**. We have
entered the age of globally distributed computing with a vengeance,
and `everything is broken`__. The hodgepodge of today's dominant
languages and frameworks offer no comprehensive solution [#]_. Monte
combines much of the expressive convenience of python with the secure
distributed computing features of E [#]_:

.. sidebar:: Object Capabilities

   Monte inherits from E a specific flavor of capability-based
   security known as object-capabilities. With object-capabilities,
   capability-oriented programming has the same flavor as
   object-oriented programming, except that capability-oriented
   programming takes the usual OO strictures more seriously. Often
   when using object-capabilities for security, one finds that a more
   secure program is simply a program that follows OO principals of
   modularization more closely.

- Distributed computing benefits from a *promise-pipelining*
  architecture that ensures that *deadlock cannot occur*.

- E has dramatic advantages for secure distributed systems.

   - All communication in E is strongly encrypted, transparently to
     the programmer. [#]_

   - Capability-based security enables the concise composition of
     powerful patterns of interoperation, patterns that enable
     extensive cooperation even in the presence of severely limited
     trust.

     Excluding user interface code, a simple but effective
     peer-to-peer secure chat system has been written in less than 30
     lines of E code; no more lines of code were required to write a
     basic digital-money bank server despite the severe security
     issues involved.

     When the time comes for a security inspection, capability
     security allows simple reachability analysis to exclude huge
     swaths of code because they cannot embody a threat. As a
     consequence, auditing a system for security becomes cost
     effective to an extent that is simply unimaginable with other
     approaches [#]_.

   - With Monte, it is straightforward to create systems that run across
     the Internet that are as secure and safe as if the entire system
     were running on a single computer in your basement. As one of the
     original developers of Smalltalk observed, upon learning about
     the object-capability paradigm from E, capability security is
     "natural security": if you shouldn't use it, you just can't see
     it.

- Monte enables the fearless yet powerful use of multi-party
   limited-trust mobile code.

These qualities cannot be achieved with traditional security
approaches. Do not expect the next release of Java, Windows, or Linux
to fix the problem: the flaws in these systems lie at the heart of
their architectures, unfixable without breaking upward compatibility,
as we shall discuss in the chapter on @@LINK Secure Distributed
Programming.

.. sidebar:: The origin of Monte's name

   The Monte language has its roots in the E and Python languages. We
   took "Monty" from "Monty Python", and put an "e" in there. Thus,
   "Monte".


E wraps these strengths in a python-like syntax to make it quickly
comfortable for a large number of software engineers. It is built with
objects at the core of its design, making it easy to write modular,
readable, maintainable software using the strategies familiar from
python, Java, and the like. It has the kind of powerful string
handling that will be recognized and seized upon by the Perl
programmer.

For both better and for worse, Monte is a dynamically typed language
like Smalltalk, not a statically typed language like Java. Users of
Perl and Python will immediately recognize this is an advantage; Java
and C++ programmers may not be so sure. While a thorough discussion of
the merits and demerits of static typing is well beyond the scope of
this document, many of the most complex yet most reliable systems in
the world today have been developed with dynamically typed
languages. We invite you to try E first and form your conclusions
later. We believe you will find the experience both pleasant and
productive, as the long heritage of programmers from Scheme to
Smalltalk to Perl and Python have found in the past.

.. note:: While Monte usable and most architectural issues are
	  resolved, it is still undergoing rapid development.
	  See :ref:`roadmap` for details.


Why not Monte?
--------------

Monte assumes automatic memory management; the current implementation
uses the pypy garbage collector. As such, it is not a good language
for low level machine manipulation. So do not try to use Monte for
writing device drivers.

And Monte's performance is currently quite unfavorable compared to raw
C, but it is designed to compete with other JIT-compiled VM languages.


Preface to Monte Documentation
------------------------------

We begin with an introduction to practical E programming. Comparisons
to python are frequent, so some understanding of python is desirable.

Later sections form the @@LINK Monte language specification.

This largely follows the structure of `E in a Walnut`__ by Marc Stiegler
and `The E Language`__ by Mark Miller.

.. todo:: To what extent do we want to invite feedback and offer
          support? i.e. what to write where Walnut says "If you
          encounter some surprising behavior not explained here,
          please join the e-lang discussion group and ask there"?

Fireworks In Part II
--------------------

Though Monte is a powerful language with which to write single-cpu
programs, the main power of Monte becomes evident only after you move into
distributed programming. It would be tempting to introduce the
distributed computing features first...except that you can't really do
any meaningful computing without the basic data, flow, function, and
object structures. So we introduce @@LINK "Ordinary Programming" Part
I before getting into the serious distributed computing
facilities.

However, since E was designed in the python syntax tradition, an
experienced programmer can probably glean enough from the @@LINK Quick
Reference Card to skip directly to @@LINK Part II on Distributed
Computing. If you are short of time and have the requisite background,
we recommend that strategy. Go back and read @@LINK Part I when you are
convinced that E's power for distributed programming meets your needs.


Getting Started
---------------

.. note:: Installing monte is in transition. The original python
	  implementation in the monte repository is largely obsolete
	  in favor of typhon.  See :ref:`roadmap` and the `monte
	  wiki`__ for more.

Interacting with the Monte REPL
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Monte has a traditional "Read - Evaluate - Print Loop", or REPL, for
exploration. For example::

  >>> 1 + 1
  2

  >>> "abc".size()
  3


Editor Syntax Highlighting
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Atom
++++

Use Atom to install the package `language-monte`__.

Diagnostics, Documentation, and Debugging
-----------------------------------------

Monte strives to provide useful error messages and self-documenting objects::

  â–²> help(Ref)
  Result: Object type: RefOps
  Ref management and utilities.
  Method: broken/1
  Method: isBroken/1
  Method: isDeepFrozen/1
  ...

Currently the most convenient way to print out messages from your program is
with the ``trace()`` and ``traceln()`` built-in functions. The only difference
between them is that ``traceln()`` automatically adds a newline.

.. rubric:: Notes

.. [#] Disciplined use of existing languages such as Java and
       JavaScript can be used to build object capability systems, but
       the standard practices and libraries are not compatible with
       this discipline.

.. [#] as documented in `the DarpaBrowser
       report<http://www.combex.com/papers/darpa-report/index.html>`

.. [#] As a practical concession, the safe scope includes ``trace()``
       and ``traceln()``. See :ref:`trace`.
