Why Monte?
----------

Don't we have enough languages already? This is a fair question.  We
can only explain why Monte is interesting to us and leave you to
judge.


Because Security Matters
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Because **secure distributed computing should not be hard**. Computers
are getting faster, smaller, more connected, and more capable, but
when it comes to security, `everything is broken`__. We propose to
reconsider the identity-based access control approach dominant in
today's dominant languages and frameworks [#]_. Monte takes the
object-capability paradigm of E [#]_ and updates it for the metamodern
era:

.. sidebar:: Object Capabilities

   Monte inherits from E a specific flavor of capability-based security known
   as object capabilities. With object capabilities, capability-oriented
   programming has the same flavor as object-oriented programming, except that
   capability-oriented programming takes the usual object-oriented constraints
   more seriously. Often when using object capabilities for security, one
   finds that a more secure program is simply a program that follows
   object-oriented principles of modularization more closely.

- Monte, like E before it, has dramatic advantages for secure distributed
  systems.

   - Monte promises benefit from a *promise-pipelining* architecture which
     ensures that *most deadlocks cannot occur*. [*]_

   - Monte offers cryptographic services directly to its users, easing the use
     of good cryptographic primitives.

   - Capability-based security enables the concise composition of powerful
     patterns of interoperation, patterns that enable extensive cooperation
     even in the presence of severely limited trust.

   - The fractal nature of POLA encourages short and readable modules, leading
     to applications having relatively low amounts of code. As a consequence,
     the attack surface of an application is decreased and code review is
     easier. The implementors of E and CapDesk boast of implementing
     peer-to-peer chat systems and digital-money bank servers in hundreds,
     *not* tens of thousands, of lines of code.

     When the time comes for a security inspection, capability security allows
     simple reachability analysis to exclude huge swaths of code because they
     cannot embody a threat. As a consequence, auditing a system for security
     becomes cost-effective to an extent that is simply unimaginable with
     other approaches [#darpa]_.

   - With Monte, it is straightforward to create systems that run across the
     Internet that are as secure and safe as if the entire system were running
     on a single computer in your basement. As one of the original developers
     of Smalltalk observed, upon learning about the object-capability paradigm
     from E, capability security is "natural security": if you shouldn't use
     it, you just can't see it.

- Monte enables the fearless yet powerful use of multi-party
  limited-trust mobile code.

.. [*] As with all sufficiently complex concurrency systems, deadlock is
       possible. That said, it has not been observed outside of
       specially-constructed pathological object graphs.


Because Readability Matters
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. sidebar:: The origin of Monte's name

   The Monte language has its roots in the E and Python languages. We
   took "Monty" from "Monty Python", and put an "e" in there. Thus,
   "Monte".

Monte wraps its strengths in a Python-like syntax to make it quickly
comfortable for a large number of software engineers. It is built with objects
at the core of its design, making it easy to write modular, readable,
maintainable software using the strategies familiar from Python, JavaScript,
Ruby, Java, and other object-based languages. It has the kind of powerful
string handling that will be recognized and seized upon by the Perl
hacker.

Because Stability Matters
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Monte is dynamically typed [#unityped]_, like Smalltalk, rather than
statically typed, like Java. Users of Perl and Python will immediately
recognize this is an advantage; Java and C++ programmers may not be so
sure. Fortunately, Monte inherits two forms of contract-based programming from
E: :ref:`guards<guards>` and :ref:`interfaces<interfaces>`.

Monte is dynamic in three ways:

Dynamic Typing
    The type of a variable might not be known until runtime, and "types are
    open".
Dynamic Binding
    It is possible to pass a message to an object that will never able to
    handle that message. This provides a late-binding sort of polymorphism.
Dynamic Compiling
    Monte can compile and run Monte code at runtime, as part of its core
    runtime.

Why not Monte?
--------------

Monte assumes automatic memory management; the current reference
implementation uses the PyPy garbage collector, and any other implementation
will have to choose a similar scheme. As such, it is not a good language for
low level machine manipulation. So do not try to use Monte for writing device
drivers.

Monte's performance is currently quite unfavorable compared to raw C, and
additionally, Monte's target niches are largely occupied by other dynamic
languages with JIT-compiler-based runtimes, so it is not a design goal to
compete with C or other memory-unsafe languages.

.. note:: While Monte's usable and most architectural issues are resolved, it
          is still undergoing rapid development. See :ref:`roadmap` for
          details.


Getting Started
---------------

Installation: Docker Image (TODO)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. todo:: docker image via nix (`#77`__)
          Meanwhile, see `Getting Started`__
          in the Monte wiki.

__ https://github.com/monte-language/typhon/issues/77
__ https://github.com/monte-language/monte/wiki/Getting-Started


Interacting with the Monte REPL
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Monte has a traditional "Read - Evaluate - Print Loop", or REPL, for
exploration. Invoke it as `mt repl`. For example::

  >>> 1 + 1
  2

  >>> "abc".size()
  3


Getting Help about an Object
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Monte strives to provide useful error messages and self-documenting objects::

  â–²> help(Ref)
  Result: Object type: RefOps
  Ref management and utilities.
  Method: broken/1
  Method: isBroken/1
  Method: isDeepFrozen/1
  ...

.. [#] Disciplined use of existing languages such as Java and
       JavaScript can be used to build object capability systems, but
       the standard practices and libraries are not compatible with
       this discipline.
