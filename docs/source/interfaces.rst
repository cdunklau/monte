Objects and Functions (TODO)
=====================


Functions (TODO)
---------

.. todo:: 

.. include:: guards.rst

New objects are created with a ``object`` keyword::

    object helloThere:
        to greet(whom):
            traceln(`Hello, my dear $whom!`)

    helloThere.greet("Student")

Objects can also be created by functions::

    def makeSalutation(time):
        return object helloThere:
            to greet(whom):
                traceln(`Good $time, my dear $whom!`)

    def hi := makeSalutation("morning")

    hi.greet("Student")


Objects (todo: Walnut-ize)
-------

Monte has a simpler approach to object composition and inheritance than many
other object-based and object-oriented languages. Instead of classes or
prototypes, Monte has a simple single syntax for constructing objects, the
object expression::

    object myObject:
        pass

Unlike Java, Monte objects are not constructed from classes. Unlike JavaScript
or Python, Monte objects are not constructed from prototypes. As a result, it
might not be obvious at first how to build multiple objects which are similar
in behavior. However, Monte has a very simple idiom for class-like constructs.

::

    def makeMyObject():
        return object myObject:
            pass

Methods can be attached to objects with the to keyword::

    object deck:
        to size():
            return 52

Finally, just like with functions, methods can have guards on their parameters
and return value::

    object deck:
        to size(suits :Int, ranks :Int) :Int:
            return suits * ranks

Where did ``self`` go?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Newcomers to Monte are often surprised to learn that Monte lacks a ``this`` or
``self`` keyword. In fact, Monte does have ways to refer to the current object,
but there's a deeper conceptual difference between Monte and other object-based
languages.

Monte does not have a ``this`` or ``self`` keyword because Monte objects can
refer to their "member" or "private" names without qualification. This is a
consequence of how Monte objects are built. Consider this object maker::

    def makeMyObject():
        return object myObject:
            pass

Let's modify it slightly. We want to give this object a "private" value secret
which cannot be accessed directly, and a method ``getSecret/0`` which will
return it. We put "private" in quotation marks to emphasize that Monte does not
have private names. Instead, all names are private in Monte; if one cannot see
a name, then one cannot access it.

::

    def makeMyObject(secret):
        return object myObject:
            to getSecret():
                return secret

And that's it. No declarations of object contents or special references to ``this``
or ``self``.

We can also simulate "member" names for objects. As before, we can achieve
this effect without ``this``.

::

    def makeMyObject():
        var counter :Int := 0
        return object myObject:
            to getCounter():
                return counter += 1

Here, ``counter`` is not visible outside of ``makeMyObject()``, which means
that no other object can directly modify it. Each time we call
``makeMyObject()``, we get a new object called ``myObject`` with a new counter.

.. note::
    Remember, Monte is an expression language. ``counter += 1`` returns the
    value of ``counter``. That's why ``return counter += 1`` works.


.. _def-fun:

Secret Life of Functions, Multiple Constructors and "Static Methods" / Does Monte have functions?
--------------------------

No. Since everything in Monte is an object, you're always calling methods
rather than functions.

Monte does have a convention that objects with a single method with the verb
``run`` are functions. There is no difference, to Monte, between this
function::

    def f():
        pass

And this object::

    object f:
        to run():
            pass



Interfaces
----------

An :dfn:`interface` is a syntactic expression which defines an object
protocol. An interface has zero or more method signatures, and can be
implemented by any object which has methods with equivalent signatures to the
interface.

Let's jump right in::

    interface Trivial:
        "A trivial interface."

This interface comes with a docstring, which is not required but certainly a
good idea, and nothing else. Any object could implement this interface::

    object trivia implements Trivial:
        "A trivial object implementing a trivial interface."

When an object **implements** an interface, the interface behaves like any
other auditor and examines the object for compliance with the object protocol.
As with other auditors, the difference between the "implements" and "as"
keywords is whether the object is required to pass the auditor::

    object levity as Trivial:
        "A trivial object which is proven to implement Trivial."

Let's look at a new interface. This interface carries some **method
signatures**.

::

    interface GetPut:
        "Getting and putting."
        to get()
        to put(value)

    object getAndPut as GetPut:
        "A poor getter and putter."

        to get():
            return "get"

        to put(_):
            null

We can see that ``getAndPut`` implements the ``GetPut`` interface, but it
isn't very faithful to that interface. Interfaces cannot enforce behavior,
only signatures.

Getting Help about an Object
----------------------------

Monte strives to provide useful error messages and self-documenting objects::

  â–²> help(Ref)
  Result: Object type: RefOps
  Ref management and utilities.
  Method: broken/1
  Method: isBroken/1
  Method: isDeepFrozen/1
