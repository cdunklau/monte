Simple data types, simple control flow
--------------------------------------

Here are some of the basics of the language::

  >>> # Comment on this piece of code
  ...
  ... def a := 3
  ... var b := a + 2
  ... b += 1
  ... if (a < b):
  ...     traceln("a is less than b")
  ... else:
  ...    traceln("Wow, the arithmetic logic unit in this processor is confused")
  null

Variable declarations are made with the ``var`` statement. Variables that are
only assigned a value once at creation (i.e., constants, or variables declared
final) are created with the def statement. In Monte, as in Python, "+=" is
shorthand for adding the righthand value to the lefthand variable.

Single-line comments have a ``#`` at the beginning, and terminate with
the end of line. The ``/**...*/`` comment style is used only for writing
javadoc-style comments, discussed later.

Assignment uses the ``:=`` operator. The single equal sign ``=`` is never
legal in Monte; use ``:=`` for assignment and ``==`` for testing
equality. The function ``traceln`` sends diagnostic output to the
console. The ``if`` statement looks just like its Python equivalent.

As with Python, a backslash (``\``) as the final character of a line
escapes the newline and causes that line and its successor to be
interpereted as one::

 â–² def c := 1 + 2 \
 ...   + 3 + 4
 Result: 10

Basic Types and Operators
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The basic types in Monte are ``Int``, ``Double``, ``Str``, ``Char``, and
``Boolean``. All integer arithmetic is unlimited precision, as if all
integers were longs.

Doubles are represented as 64-bit IEEE floating point numbers. The
operators ``+``, ``-``, ``*`` have their traditional meanings for integers and
floats. The normal division operator ``/`` always gives you a floating
point result. The floor divide operator ``//`` always gives you an
integer, truncated towards negative infinity. So::

  >>> -3.5 // 1
  -4

The Monte modulo operator, ``%``, like the Python modulo operator, returns the
remainder of division that truncates towards zero.

Operator precedence is generally the same as in Java, Python, or C. In
a few cases, Monte will throw a syntax error and require the use of
parentheses.

Monte's quasi-literals enable the easy processing of complex strings
as described in detail later; here is a very simple example::

 >>> def x := 3
 ... `Value of x is: $x`
 "Value of x is: 3"

wherein the back-ticks denote a quasi-literal, and the dollar sign
denotes a variable whose value is to be embedded in the string.

``+`` when used with strings is a concatenation operator as in Python. Unlike
Java, it does *not* automatically coerce other types on the right-hand if the
left-hand operand is a string.

``&&`` and ``||`` and ``!`` have their traditional meanings for booleans;
``true`` and ``false`` are boolean constants.

Strings are enclosed in double quotes. Characters are enclosed in
single quotes, and the backslash acts as an escape character as in
Java, and C: '\n' is the newline character, and '\\' is the backslash
character.

``==`` and ``!=`` are the boolean tests for equality and inequality
respectively. When the equality test is used between appropriately
designated :ref:`transparent immutables<selfless>`, such as
integers, the values are compared to see if the values are equal; for
other objects the references are compared to see if both the left and
right sides of the operator refer to the same object. Chars, booleans,
integers, and floating point numbers are all compared by value, as are
Strings, ConstLists, and ConstMaps.

Additional useful features of transparent immutables are discussed
under :ref:`distributed-computing`.

There are some special rules about the behavior of the basic operators
because of E's distributed security. These rules are described in the
Under the :ref:`Under the Covers<under-cover-objects>` section later
in this chapter.

Using Monte Modules
-------------------

*TODO: just document using modules here; move other stuff*

A Monte module is a single file. The last statement in the file describes what
it exports. If the last statement in a file defines a method or object, that
method or object is what you get when you import it. If you want to export
several objects from the same file, the last line in the file should simply be
a list of their names.

To import a module, simply use ``def bar = import("foo")`` where the filename of
the module is foo.mt. See the files module.mt and imports.mt for an example of
how to export and import objects.
